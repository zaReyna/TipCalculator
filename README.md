# TipCalculator
This is a tip calculator with simple code that helped me become familar with CSS and JavaScript. It calculates the total of your bill based on the percentage that you would like to give back as tip and divided among the number of people in your group. 

What I learned from making this project:

- utilizing layout and placement of items using CSS
- how to make and use loops using JavaScript
- how to use a function of paseInt to covert a string to number using JavaScript
- how to use conditional statements using JavaScript
- how to calculate values in JavaScript and round to 2 decimal places using toFixed method
